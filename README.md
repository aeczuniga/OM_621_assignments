This repository is for homework assignments for Dr. Karimi, California State University of San Marcos (**OM_621**). It is not in your interest to utilize the information, there are errors. I am learning and I am documenting my assignments as I go. This repository is utilizng Visual Studio Code (Python), I am describing what did. I suggest you look at the Python notebook for more context. The dataset has been provided for me.

The **first Python assignment** is addressing basic data exploration.
    **Question 1** looks into invoicing delays according to a company experiecning delayed invoicing. This question addresses my process for the entire project. Ultimately, there is a seasonality and mode factor influencing delayed invoicing but I think contractual terms should be looked over to ensure all is well.
    
    **Question 2** looks missing values and basic calculations like average and minimum, starting simple.
    
    Question 3 creates a ggplot to visualize the data, making it easy to identify information instead of calculations. 
    
    Question 4 
    
    Question 5

    Question 6 
    Question 7
